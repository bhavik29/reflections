We need git init to create a repository.

staging area enables to add changes on a temporary basis. Subsequently, you can add all the files from a staging area collectively to the repository.

Staging area can be used to add only one file to it and later commiting that file to the repository.

Branches would make the experimentation easy and subsequently merging the changes if the experiment was succesful.

Diagrams help in visualising how branches work and how merging of branches will progress the project.

Merging the two branches help us to test new features and add them after we have finalised. The diagram helps us keep a mental track of the branches.

Manually merging will help us commit the better version of code. Git might delete the more efficient code and merge the less efficient code.
